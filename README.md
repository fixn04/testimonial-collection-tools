## FAQ

### How do I get customers to actually submit video testimonials?

Make the process ridiculously easy by sending direct links that open in browsers without downloads, keep requests under 3 questions to avoid overwhelming customers, and personally reach out to your happiest customers who already expressed satisfaction. Adding video messages to collection forms increases response rates by making requests feel personal rather than automated. Follow up once if they don't respond initially, but avoid being pushy—genuine enthusiastic testimonials come from customers who genuinely want to help.

### Can I import existing reviews from Google, Facebook, and social media?

Most modern testimonial platforms import reviews from 10-26 external sources including Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Reddit, and review sites like G2 Crowd and Trustpilot. You typically copy-paste review links or connect accounts, and the platform automatically pulls positive mentions and formats them as testimonials. Some tools offer auto-sync keeping imported reviews current without manual updates.

### What's the difference between Walls of Love and embedded widgets?

Walls of Love are dedicated standalone pages displaying all your testimonials in one branded showcase that you can link to from anywhere. Embedded widgets are small code snippets you paste into existing website pages showing specific testimonials inline with your content—like product pages, homepages, or pricing sections. Most platforms provide both options, letting you choose based on where you want social proof displayed.
